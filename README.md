# Vanier-College-Integrative-Project
The final semester programming project of the Computer Science and Mathematics program at Vanier College that incorporated Mechanics, 
Waves and Optics, and Calculus into one interactive learning tool application developed in JavaFX. 
Was done by Ahmad El-Baher and Dylan Seto.

The application is split into 4 windows: an animation window (top left), a data label (top right), a user input window (bottom right),
and a main menu window (bottom left).

The user chooses a topic in the main menu window to start: Mechanics, Waves, Calculus. Then the user chooses a sub category depending
on the topic: Newton's second law or projectile motion for Mechanics, optics or thin film interference for Waves, and new sports bike
or geometric series for Calculus.

Then the user can enter values for the variables depending on the category, and then play the animation. The animation will animate
the concept depending on the values input, and the appropriate data will appear on the data window. For example, if the user chose
projectile motion, he/she can enter values for the gravity, acceleration, and launch angle. Then the animation will show a cannon
firing a projectile at the speed specified with the angle specified, and the object will fall with the gravitational force
specified. The data window will then show the vertical position of the object against time in a graph.

I received a 94% in this course, which included the planning stage, the project itself, and the final reports.
